This project is a LOVE2D game built using Lua. It is a game where you play as a Harvard student fighting of waves of other Ivy League students. 





Video Link: (note: the game runs MUCH smoother than our video shows, but the recording software we used captured at a low frame rate and so the video makes the game look laggy. The game runs seamlessly for Colin and I on our own computers when launching from the executable)

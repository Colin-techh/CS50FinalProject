# Yuck Fale
**By Colin Williams and Levi Develice**

This project is a LOVE2D game built using Lua. It is a game where you play as a Harvard student fighting of waves of other Ivy League students.

## How to Run
The source code .lua files are submitted with this README and DESIGN. Unless Love2d is installed on your computer, you will **not** be able to run the game from the source code alone. To run the game, you need to run the executable that corresponds with your operating system. To help you run the game, we've built two executables (one for Windows and one for MacOS) available at this link:

In this link are .zip files, to run the game, you need to download the .zip, unzip it (to like your downloads folder or something it does not matter), and then run the YuckFale executable in this file and the game should open up as a LOVE window for you to play.

Depending on your settings, your operating system may throw security warnings. We assure you that the executables are perfectly safe.


## Project Structure
This game is built using the LOVE2D game engine with the Lua programming language. In the source code you will find a number of .lua scripts. The primary script is *main.lua*. There are many other helper scripts along with *main.lua* that define the behavior of the game. These scripts are imported using various require statements, as is convention with the Lua programming language. 

## Note on Video

Video: https://youtu.be/pk_gjErTEfw

Note: the game runs MUCH smoother than our video shows, but the recording software we used captured at a low frame rate and so the video makes the game look laggy. The game runs seamlessly for Colin and I on our own computers when launching from the executable
